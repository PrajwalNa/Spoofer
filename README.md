# Spoofer
An old project I decided to rework and document the code
Nothing too complex, a very bare bones ARP based IP spoofer I made to understand the workings of a network connection.

# Usage
python 3 ./pySpoofer.py -t/--target (Target IP) -g/--gateway (Router IP) [-h/--help (Help)]

# Dependecies
Scapy:
  pip3 install scapy
